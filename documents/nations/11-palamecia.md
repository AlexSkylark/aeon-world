### Palamecia

- Palamecia is a floating city in the sky, hidden from the world by magic.
- The city was founded by dissident wizards who attempted to prevent a cataclysm.
- The city is populated by magic users from before the cataclysm, who have vowed to never let magic return to the world.
- Palamecian society is structured around three magical orders: The Ivory Circle, the Shadow Covenant, and the Crimson Legion.
- Each order specializes in different types of magic: restorative and healing spells, destructive and martial magic, and a combination of the two with extensive martial training.
- Each order is led by a Magister, who oversees internal affairs.
- The Custodians of Magic are held as the ultimate guardians of magical knowledge.
- Palamecia's history is closely tied to the cataclysm and the city's founding, as well as the three orders and their roles in maintaining magical balance.


Children begin attending the Arcanum Institute at the age of 4 to learn basic magical arts, history, philosophy, and mathematics.
At age 16, students are placed as a candidate member of one of the three orders, where they pursue their final levels of education and compete with their peers in sports, arts, and magical competitions.
