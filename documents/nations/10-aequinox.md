#### The Aequinoxian Myths

The info below is not taken as hard truth by the Aequinoxians, instead being the basis of their religious faith.

- The Eikons used to walk among the peoples of the world before the cataclysm.
- The cataclysm was caused by the indiscriminate use of Magitek that nearly depleted the world's Aether, causing the Eikons to abandon the planet.
- The Aequinoxians are supposedly the people who answered the call of the Eikons to take refuge with them during the cataclysm.
- The summoners' purpose is to prepare and develop for the day when Aeon's Aetheric levels are brought to what they were prior to the cataclysm, when the Eikons will return to rule the world.
- Their ultimate goal as the chosen people of the Eikons is to serve as their heralds and intermediaries upon the return of the Eikons.
