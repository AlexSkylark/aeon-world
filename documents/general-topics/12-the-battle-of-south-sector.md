### The Battle of South Sector

The Summoners of Aequinox were deeply concerned about the empire of Accordia's new interest in Magitek technology. They knew firsthand the dangers of such technology, as they believed it to be the cause of the near-destruction of the planet in the past cataclysm. Kardion Sorento, a skilled Summoner, was selected to lead a team of operatives to infiltrate the empire and collect information about their research.

Kardion's team consisted of his wife, Ariana Sorento, a talented researcher, Faralis Karen, his best friend and comrade-in-arms, and Renna Lenard, an experienced summoner and military strategist. The team infiltrated the empire's capital city of Nexus and managed to blend in with the populace. They quickly discovered that the empire's Magitek research was just nascent, but they also discovered that the empire was planning to use the technology for military purposes. 

During their mission, Kardion and Ariana conceive a child, who is born in Accordia. As they plan their return, the team retrieves valuable data on the empire's magitek research program. They just found evidence that the main purpose of the project was to develop advanced weaponry to wage war on the entire world as they did once a century ago. 

Kardion and the others come to the conclusion that the empire is relentless and inflexible in the political sphere, and that the only way to halt the empire's development of magitek would be by force, destroying all research data and samples on the subject, along with the entire scientific facility where Magitek was being researched. However, Aequinox would never approve taking direct action against an empire from the world below, as their current stance was to be mere observers in preparation for the future. As such, the four of them were the only ones capable of executing such a dangerous mission, and they would be alone in that decision, without support from Aequinox. The other three were hesitant at first, knowing the risks and the consequences, but they eventually agreed that it was the right thing to do. They knew that it would be a difficult task, and they all understood the risks involved.

Ariana loved her baby boy dearly, but she also knew that the mission was too important to pass up. She arranged for a trusted couple to care for her son while she and the others went on their mission. They promised to return for the baby as soon as the mission was completed.

They carefully planned their attack and were successful in infiltrating the facility. However, as they were planting explosives, they were discovered by the Accordian military. Without other choice, the summoners saw themselves forced to call upon their Eikons. They succeeded in destroying most of the military base, but that provoked a maximum response from the empire, who sent the full might of their military upon them, including their battleships and artilleries. Kardion knew that he was the only one who could buy them time to escape. As the rest of the team fled, Kardion stayed behind to face the Accordian forces head-on, buying his comrades the time they needed to escape. The team then sent a distress signal to Aequinox for an emergency extraction, and were planning to pick up Ariana's child on their way, but she was gravely wounded during the escape, leaving Faralis and Renna to take the difficult decision of bringing Ariana back to Aequinox as quickly as possible, as her life was in grave danger and she needed urgent medical attention. So, they flee for Aequinox, leaving the baby behind.

Despite the destruction of the facility and Kardion's heroic sacrifice, Accordia was able to recover much of what they had lost in Magitek research. When Kardion's body was found, the technology and equipment he was wearing were recovered and analyzed. The Accordians were able to rebuild the Magitek project and use it to advance their research much quicker than they would have been able to otherwise, setting them on a path to become even more powerful than before. Despite the sacrifices made by the team, their mission ultimately failed to achieve its goal.

The team's failure was a devastating blow to all people involved, but Faralis was the one who took it the hardest. He was already a critic of the path of isolation and passiveness taken by the Aequinoxians, but the episode, his complete and utter failure, and his best friend dying in vain, all of this ultimately sent him over the edge. He got determined to spur his people into action. Promising to do whatever it takes to make Aequinox take an active role in the world of Aeon, even if he had to do it alone, he took this vow, screamed Kardion's name to the stars above as a symbol of his resolve.
