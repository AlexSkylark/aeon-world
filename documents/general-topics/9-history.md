## Historical Ages

### The Elder Times

- The Elder Times are a time of great mystery as there are no recorded accounts of its society or geography.
- Speculation suggests that the elder world was extremely advanced technologically and that magick was commonplace.
- Historians believe that Aeon was home to a highly advanced civilization where machines did most of the work and people lived longer, with most diseases being treatable.
- The nature of the cataclysm that brought about the end of the Elder Times is also shrouded in mystery, with accounts suggesting a global-spanning great war and widespread use of magick.

### The Age of Chaos

- Age of Chaos lasted until about 200 kH
- Survivors of the cataclysm struggled to survive in a world populated by horrible creatures and plagued by famine and disease
- Ancient forests were replaced by barren plains and rocky hills, and vast deserts covered much of the Northern continent of Othardia
- After about a century, survivors began banding together in camps to survive
- Cities such as Northveil and Asper were founded in Othardia, Drakkar in Accordia, and Alexander in Valleria
- A budding industry and architecture began to take form, guaranteeing the survival of this new civilization.

### The Age of Rebuilding

- The Age of Rebuilding began after the Age of Chaos and lasted until 738 kH.
- During this period, the world emerged from the cataclysm and the peoples of Aeon were no longer facing extinction.
- Cities and settlements grew larger and began to connect through new trade routes, roads, and other types of connections.
- By 300 kH, most of the biggest settlements in the world had evolved into large city-states and began to enter into conflict with each other for resources and political influence.
- The disorganized way societies shifted focus from mere survival to enrichment and expansion led to increasing social inequality and the rising of criminal activities in all major cities.
- Large settlements started banding together or being forcefully annexed to their stronger neighbors, and slowly over the centuries, three of the biggest settlements vastly expanded their sphere of influence and consolidated themselves as the primary state in each of their native continents: Varennia in Othardia, Drakkar in Accordia, and Alexandria in Valleria.
- As commerce and communication evolved, science also progressed, and many new technologies were created.
- The three great nations reached a point of equilibrium, where they retained influence over their continents and cooperated through trade and scientific cooperation, achieving peace through an unwritten mutual agreement.
- However, by the dawn of the seventh century, resources began to run scarce, and thoughts of a war between the three nations were seen as almost certain by 730 kH.

### The Great War

- The Great War started in 739 kH when the Kingdom of Drakkar was dissolved and turned into the Great Empire of Accordia, a despotic new nation ruled by an "Immortal Emperor" and a number of high-ranking military officers.
- Accordia launched an overwhelming offense, first at the city-state of Torus, a former vassal state of Drakkar and still loyal to its monarchy, and then to the northern continent, Othardia.
- Alexandria quickly capitulated and was transformed into an imperial protectorate, but Varennia allied itself with the extremely rich and powerful city-state of Moldhar and mounted fierce opposition to imperial advance in its continent.
- The war lasted for 18 years, with the most relevant event being the Burning of Moldhar, when the emperor launched an attack meant to leave no survivors, bombarding the city by airships for fourteen days and nights without ceasing, and completely razed it to the ground.
- The event shook the entire world to its core, and Varennia urged all the peoples of Aeon to band together against the empire and its crazed leader.
- Alexandria declared independence and joined the alliance, along with every independent state across Othardia and Valleria.
- The empire was driven back from the upper continents and the city of Torus was liberated.
- After losing all the territories it conquered in Othardia and Valleria, the empire was driven back to its original continent at the south, and the ensuing war of attrition ended in a stalemate.
- A peace treaty was signed in 758 kH at the city of Torus.

### The Age of Prosperity

- The Age of Prosperity began after the end of the Great War in 758 kH.
- The peace treaty signed in the city of Torus established a new balance of power between the nations of Aeon, with Accordia, Varennia, and Alexandria recognized as the dominant powers.
- The devastation of the Burning of Moldhar spurred a period of rebuilding and reconstruction across the world, with new cities and infrastructure being built in the wake of the war.
- Science and technology continued to progress rapidly during this time, leading to advancements in medicine, transportation, communication, and other fields.
- Trade and commerce flourished, with new trade routes and economic systems being established across the world. The three dominant powers of Accordia, Varennia, and Alexandria controlled the majority of global trade and formed powerful economic alliances.
- The arts and culture also experienced a renaissance during this time, with new forms of literature, music, and visual art emerging across the world. Many great works of art and literature were produced during this time, and the world saw a period of great creativity and innovation.
- However, social inequality continued to be a problem, with many people living in poverty while a small elite enjoyed great wealth and power.
- After the great war, the world entered a long period of peace.
- Alexandria rejected full technological advancement, maintaining a traditionalist culture with high moral standards and acting as "Guardians of the world" with peacekeeping missions.
- Accordia became isolated, developing its own science with little ethical restraint and becoming highly advanced.
- Varennia went through its own industrial revolution, embracing capitalist and libertarian values and becoming the dominant political and economic power in the world.
