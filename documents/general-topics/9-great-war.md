# The Great War

- The Great War erupts between Varennia, Alexandria, and Accordia.
- Year 1-2: Accordian forces make significant gains in the early stages of the war, using their superior technology and tactics to overwhelm their enemies.
Alexandria falls under Accordian control.
- Year 3-5: Varennian and Alexandrian forces struggle to push back against Accordia, despite resistance movements within Alexandria.
- Year 6-8: The war reaches a stalemate, with none of the major powers able to gain a decisive advantage over the others.
- Year 9: Moldhar, a peaceful, but very rich vassal state to Varennia that excelled in culture, architecture and arts who was helping Varennia fund the war effort, is bombarded by Accordia until it is completely destroyed. This event becomes known as the "Burning of Moldhar" and causes widespread outrage and condemnation throughout the world.
- Year 10: The empire's brutal attack on Moldhar galvanizes Alexandrian forces, who manage to rally other nations to their cause and form a powerful alliance against the empire.
- Year 11-17: The combined forces of Varennia, Alexandria, and their allies, now known as the Global Alliance, manages to push Accordia back to its borders and reclaim Alexandria.
- Year 18: Despite attempts at negotiations, the war ends in yet another stalemate, with all sides agreeing to a ceasefire and the establishment of Torus as neutral territory.
- After the war, Alexandria declares itself the "Guardian of the World" and assumes the role of defending freedom and justice, seeking to prevent any future wars like the Great War from occurring.
