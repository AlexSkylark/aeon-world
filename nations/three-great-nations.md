# The Three Great Nations

## Varennia

- Official Name: Republic of Varennia
- Located on the northern continent of Othardia, Varennia is the greatest political and economic power of the world.
- Known for its advanced technology and industry, it has early 20th century technology.
- Varennia has a capitalist/libertarian-oriented culture.
- Its capital city is also called Varennia and has an art deco style of architecture with a "film noir" feeling to it.
- The government is led by a prime-minister, who is elected by a senate formed through general elections. However, the country is, in practice, led by an elite oligarchy of private business owners who exert pressure over government officials through lobbying and campaign financing.
- Varennia is a republic, and it puts up a democracy facade to the public.
  
## Accordia

- Accordia is a despotic totalitarian nation in the southern continent, ruled by a single person, the "eternal emperor"
- It is the most scientifically advanced place in the world, with a quasi-futuristic scenario covering its territory
- The empire capital, Nexus, is a sprawling metropolis engulfed in eternal darkness, with daylight struggling to break through the thick cloud of chemical pollution above the city
- Only around noon, the city sees any sunlight in the form of red streaks of light piercing through dark clouds
- Accordia is a place of contrast, with a noble elite living with every comfort, while all work is done by a mixture of automatons and the marginalized poor
- Not having a job is a crime within the borders of the empire, so most people see themselves forced to accept poor working conditions and meager pay to avoid persecution
- There is an intense cult of personality built around the figure of the emperor, who is worshipped like a divinity by all citizens, rich or poor
- The lower classes are educated since very young to erase their sense of individuality by an extremely oppressive educational system that inhibits in students their sense of freedom and individual value, effectively engineering a lower caste

## Alexandria

- Located on the Eastern continent of Valleria
- Known as the "sun kingdom"
- Agrarian nation with the most fertile ground and temperate climate
- Main source of world's food and chocobos (giant bird-like animal used for transportation, workforce, and food)
- Farms mostly owned by individual families and small cooperative initiatives
- Culture values high moral standards and traditional methods, avoids higher aspects of technology
- Deep sense of regret for surrendering to Accordian Empire in the Imperial War and brief industrial phase under Accordian rule
- Dragoon Knights are elite warriors and the greatest honor for an Alexandrian citizen
- Symbolize positive traits of intelligence, strength, skill in combat, and kindness
- Dragoons are peace-keeping soldiers providing humanitarian aid, fighting injustices, and helping wherever needed
- Governments of Varennia and Accordia view Dragoons with suspicion, as they are seen as an Alexandrian attempt at meddling in international affairs.
